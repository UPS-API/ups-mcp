# UPS MCP Server
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for UPS shipping and logistics capabilities. This server enables AI systems to seamlessly integrate with UPS API tools. 

Users can integrate with the MCP server to allow AI agents to facilitate tracking events on their behalf, including tracking the status of a shipment, the latest transit screen, and expected delivery date and time. Agents will be authenticated using OAuth client credentials provided by the user after application creation on the UPS Developer Portal.  

## Usage
**Prerequisites**
- Obtain a Client ID and Client Secret: Create an application on the UPS Developer Portal to obtain your OAuth credentials â€“ Client ID and Client Secret. (https://developer.ups.com/get-started?loc=en_US)
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Install uv (Python Package)

**Environment Variables**
- ```CLIENT_ID``` - UPS Client ID
- ```CLIENT_SECRET``` - UPS Client Secret
- ```ENVIRONMENT``` - Whether to point to Test (CIE) or Production (Accepted values: test, production)

Environment variables will be loaded from a .env file in the project's root directory.

**Execution**

You can run the package using uvx:

```uvx --from git+https://github.com/UPS-API/ups-mcp ups-mcp```
